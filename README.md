# MacrocycleConfGenNOE

This branch of the repository reflects the state of the project at the end 
of the semester project in December 2020.

The project incorporates NOE data to reduce the search space for conformer 
generation with regard to cyclic peptides. It builds on RDKit with ETKDGv3 
and thus requires RDKit 2020.09.02 or higher. See requirements.txt for other 
dependencies. Mlddec and cpeptools are not conda-installable and can be found 
at https://github.com/rinikerlab/mlddec and https://github.com/rinikerlab/cpeptools.
